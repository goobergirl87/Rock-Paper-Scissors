# Rock-Paper-Scissors

So far Rock, paper, scissors was the highest mountain to climb. TOP provides a lot of reading resources, so fighting through all the JavaScript Fundamentals to get to the next project was a challenge. So far the journey felt quite easy but now I had reached a point, where I needed to show myself, if I really wanted to keep on going. The curriculum provides besides the plain knowledge also really helpful resources on problem-solving, writing clean code and understanding errors. Also they make very clear at the beginning that thereâ€™ll be ups and downs.

I started the project with a lot of enthusiasm, but got stuck very soon. My main issue was, that I wanted to solve too many problems at once or that I was not able to point out the different problems at all. Coding can be overwhelming, not knowing where to start. TOPs section on writing pseudocode was a huge help and put me on the right path again.

As soon I was done with the plain console game, TOP send me through the DOM manipulation topic, so I could start with the graphical user interface. Besides learning on how to create elements and addEventListeners via JavaScript, I also learned about branching in Git. Making the GUI and seeing it come to life was a wholesome experience for that project. So who wants to play a round?!
